How it works?
    Any user who can use internet can access the website by using url.
    For Sellers...
        First Users have to signup and create a profile to post item. Then they can navigate to sell page, which enables them to post the photos, discriptions and price of the item they are thinking to sell. sell page will present a form to upload photos, write descriptions and price of the item. The website also allows users to update their profile like changing their profile photo, username and bio. The website also allows Users to signout and delete their account if they are not satisfied with the website.
    For Buyers...
        Buyers can see the posts when they open the home page. The post comes according to the time it is posted. The most recent post comes first. Buyers can search using the name of the item they want. For instance a man who wants to buy a car can search by typing "car" in the search place. The search result will be recently posted car type items. Users can also use the category link to get all the categories of items present on the webpage. If a user is interested to buy an item he/she can use one of the two methods. The first is to leave a message by clicking on "message" button and the second method is to call directly to the seller using the contact number he posted.
